# Photos

##  What am I?
I am Photos, a simple Electron wrapper housing the Google Photos website.
In other words, I'm a simple, minimal web browser locked down to just the Photos site and only the Photos site. I'm also a native Windows app.

### Installation
To install, simply download the latest Master Branch and run the "Install Photos.exe" program within.
