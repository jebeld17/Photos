# Photos

##  What am I?
I am Photos, a simple Electron wrapper housing the Google Photos website.
In other words, I'm a simple, minimal web browser locked down to just the Photos site and only the Photos site. I'm also a native Windows app.

Everything is a work-in-progress with an installer in the works, so please excuse the dust. For now, you can download the program's "Master" branch and run the included ".lnk" file to get going.
